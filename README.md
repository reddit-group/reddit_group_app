## Getting Started
### The steps below will allow you to see what the app currently looks like

Prerequisites:
Make sure you have the following installed first:
* Node.js. In a command prompt, type in `node -v` to verify. It should return a version number.
* [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) Type in `nodemon -v` to verify. If not, install by typing `npm install -g nodemon`

1. `git clone https://github.com/reddit-group/reddit_group_app.git`
2. Verify you are in the root project directory
3.`npm install` to install required dependencies
4. `nodemon`. Wait a bit. Terminal window should say: "APP IS RUNNING ON..."
5. In a browser's window, navigate to http://localhost:3000/
