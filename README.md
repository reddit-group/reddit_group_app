# Welcome to the Reddit Group Collaboration App!
## Getting Started

Note: Make sure you already have Node.js installed. In a command prompt, type in `node -v` to verify. It should return a version number.

1. `git clone https://github.com/PhilJayN/reddit_group_app.git`
2. Verify you are in the root project directory
3. In the command line type in `node index.js`. Terminal window should say: "APP IS RUNNING ON..."
4. In a browser's window, navigate to http://localhost:3000/
5. If all is working, you'll see a 'Hi there!!' message displayed on browser window

## Don't hesitate to ask question! :)
